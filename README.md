Hi there,

Hacktoberfest is a month-long challenge. It happens every year in the month of October.

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone and it marks the celebration of Open Source. It's the biggest Open Source event that encourages newbies to participate in Open Source and create their 1st meaningful PR(pull request).

HOW DOES IT WORK?

1. Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate.
2. Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.
3. Engaged maintenance of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.

Step 2: Register for Hacktoberfest: Navigate to the Hacktoberfest registration page and follow the instructions. But, read the rules carefully before you do and then sign in using your GitHub credentials.
Step 3: Find good projects worth contributing on the GitHub page. You can type label:hactoberfest is:issue is:open
You can add a language label of your choice to filter open issues. If you are a beginner and can’t find good issues then there’s tag label:good first issue which filters out issues for beginners who want to contribute.
Step 4: Submit PRs: Try and submit at least 4 PRs and wait for it to be verified. Make sure to submit quality PRs.
